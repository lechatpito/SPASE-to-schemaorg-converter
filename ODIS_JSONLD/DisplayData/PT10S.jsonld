  "description": "Section 4.1 of the text describes our procedure for identifying the locations of x-lines in a map of the neutral surface. \n\t  At each value of Y in an interpolated grid, we scan the entire length of the trace of Vx from -10 to -70 Re. A function finds all \n\t  intervals of Vx>=250 km/s and Vx less then or equal to -250 km/s.  We call these earthward and tailward fast flow intervals. We define \n\t  a bifurcation of fast flow as the point at which Vx changes sign from fast earthward to fast tailward flow. In simple cases, this \n\t  transition occurs in about 2 Re (20 grid points). The zero crossing is the location of the x-line at this value of Y. As described \n\t  in the text, we process the arrays of zero crossings to define a line in the neutral surface. We display this information as lines \n\t  parallel to X at fixed Y. Intervals of fast earthward flow are represented by a thick red line. Fast flow is  a thick blue line. The \n\t  zero crossing is a gray circle. After completion of the plot, we add x-lines as colored ropes (yellow with black stripes). Each map is \n\t  in a file and subsequently made into a movie. The movie illustrates the formation and evolution of x-lines.\n\t  \n      The movie begins at 04:00 UT with at least five significant x-lines and six earthward flow channels. This is the start of the growth \n\t  phase of a substorm. As time advances the locations of the x-lines change as flow channels move away from them. New lines form and \n\t  channels merge. When the movie approaches substorm onset at 04:44 UT the x-lines merge into a single long x-line stretching diagonally \n\t  across the tail. About 04:35, the nose of the fast earthward flow channel penetrates close to the Earth, and then begins to sweep \n\t  westward to earlier local times. At this, time the movie mS02 and the text Figure 13 shows magnetic flux accumulating close to the Earth. \n\t  At 04:50 UT, the single channels spawns new channels that flow directly toward Earth rather  than along the diagonal channel.\n      ",
