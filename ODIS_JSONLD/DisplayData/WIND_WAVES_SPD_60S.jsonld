  "description": "This data set contains Wind Waves RAD2, RAD1, and TNR 24h dynamic spectrogram plots with frequency in kHz on the vertical axis and time in UT on the horizontal axis. These plots present the WIND WAVES radio data in the whole nominal range of frequencies, from 4 kHz to 13.825 MHz. They are produced from the 60-s averaged data",
