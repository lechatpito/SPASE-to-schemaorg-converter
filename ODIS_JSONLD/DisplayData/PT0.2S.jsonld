  "sdDatePublished": "2022-02-19",
  "description": "These plots consist of 2 MHz wide 200 millisecond long very-high time resolution spectrograms in Right or Left Circular Polarization tunable from 16-32 MHz. These observations were made at the AJ4CO Observatory using a Terminated Folded Dipole (TFD) Array and a Tunable Wideband Receiver system. The system provides either Right Circularly Polarized (RCP) or Left Circularly Polarized (LCP) data. These data are generated using the Radio-Sky Spectrograph Software.\n\nThese data may include observations of Solar Radio Bursts, Jupiter decametric radio emission, or Galactic Background radio emission. In particular these data enable studies of fine-structure in Jovian decametric S-bursts.",
