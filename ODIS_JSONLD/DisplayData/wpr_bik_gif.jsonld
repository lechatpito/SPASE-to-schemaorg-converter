  "description": "The time-height plots of three components of wind velocity (zonal, meridional and vertical winds), echo power and spectral width of five radar beams in the lower troposphere between 0.2 and 10.0 km taken by the transportable wind profiler (called LQ7) at Biak, Indonesia (1.18S, 136.10E, 15m MSL). File names are composed of date and variable abbreviations: (year)(month).(variable).gif (1-month plot) or (year)(month)(day).(variable).gif (1-day plot). The variable abbreviations are wnd, pwr and wdt, which mean wind velocity, echo power and spectral width, respectively. Local time (UT+09:00) is used for time data. The right panels of each time-height plot are 1-day or 1-month average profiles of each parameter as a function of height.",
