  "description": "Global distribution of dry air temperature variance in a height range of 10 - 30 km calculated by applying full spectrum inversion (FSI) [Jensen et al., 2003] method to COSMIC GPS-RO profiles. The temperature variance is derived on the basis of a deviation from the smoothed original FSI data with a height width of 5.0 km. The horizontal and vertical axes are geographic longitude and latitude, respectively. The color bar is a dry air temperature variance in a range from 0.0 to 5.0 (degrees C)^2. File name of the height-latitude plot is composed of YYYYMMDD_dt_2dmap_10.0000km.png. YYYY, MM, and DD indicate year, month, and day, respectively.",
