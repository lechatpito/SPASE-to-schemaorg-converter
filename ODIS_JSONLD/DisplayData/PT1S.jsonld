Each plot contains 4\r\n   dynamic spectrograms, two for the North-South antennas and two for\r\n   the East-West antennas. For each pair one spectrogram spans a\r\n   frequency range of 100 Hz to 10 kHz while the other spans from 100\r\n   Hz to 75 kHz. Following the four dynamic spectrograms are two\r\n   amplitude vs. time plots for the North-South and East-West\r\n   antennas.\r\n\r\nA directory tree structure allows access to these files.
