  "description": "\nThis dataset contains PNG format plots of 2 hour duration Magnetic Field QuickLook time series (Btot, and Bx, By, Bz in GSM-DMPA coordinates and Bx, By, Bz in DMPA coordinates*) and 3-component survey spectrograms for MMS1, MMS2, MMS3, MMS4 from the Fields suite on the MMS spacecraft.\n\nAlso available within the same directory are 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour plots. Magnetic field quicklook spectrograms also appear in the individual spacecraft summary plots all_mms1_summ,  all_mms2_summ, all_mms3_summ, and all_mms4_summ.   \n\nAt the top of each image is a title and a status bar indicating operational status for Fast and Burst mode over the time period of the plots. Immediately above the time labels on the horizontal axis are ephemeris data: Cartesian GSE coordinates and radial distance of the MMS1 spacecraft in units of Earth radii.\n-------\n(*)From the FGM Data Products Guide:\n\nQuicklook data have the best available calibration at the time of downlink applied and are not intended for scientific analysis.\n\nQuicklook provides time series plots in .png format of FGM data, which is derived from either DFG or AFG.\n\nMagnetic field data is provided in Despun Major Principal Axis of inertia (DMPA) coordinates, which is considered to be a \u2018near-GSE\u2019 coordinate system. That is, no attitude data has been applied, other than to despin using the on-board sun pulse times. The DMPA Z-axis is the aligned with the Major Principal Axis (MPA). In nominal operations, the MPA is maintained to be within 3 degrees of the GSE Z-axis (ecliptic normal). Thus, within the Region of Interest (ROI), DMPA should be within 3 degrees of alignment with true GSE coordinates. The MPA can\nbe assumed to fixed in inertial space and aligned with the Angular Momentum vector, except in the presence of nutation. For the first year since launch, nutation has been observed to be minimal, and generally damped within hours after spacecraft maneuvers.\nIn addition, a GSE to GSM transformation is applied to the DMPA data to yield data in what is termed GSM-DMPA coordinates. For a formal discussion of coordinate systems, see the MMS Project Coordinate System and Alignment Document (461-SYS-SPEC-0115C, or most recent version).\n\n",
