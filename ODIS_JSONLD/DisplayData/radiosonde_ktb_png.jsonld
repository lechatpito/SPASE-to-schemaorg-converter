  "description": "Profiles of pressure, temperature, relative humidity, zonal and meridional wind data in the troposphere and lower stratosphere (0-40 km)observed by radiosonde soundings at Kototabang, Indonesia (0.20S, 100.32E, 865m MSL) since September 27, 1998. File names of png data are composed of (year)(month)(day)(hour)(minute).png in universal time. The value of -999 means missing data. During the CPEA-II campaign (November 25-23 December, 2005), the balloons were released every hours during 30 November E1 December, 3 E December, 6 E December, 9 E0 December, 12 E3 December, 15 E6 December, 18 E9 December, 2005. For launching every hour, three receivers have been used.",
