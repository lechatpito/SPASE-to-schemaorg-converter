  "description": "The time-range plots of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), line-of-sight Doppler velocity, and spectral width taken by the VHF radar at Kototabang (0.20oS, 100.32oE), Indonesia in the E and F region field-aligned irregularity (FAI) observation modes. The Doppler velocity and spectral width are obtained from the first and second order moment of the echo spectrum, respectively. These observations cover altitude rage from 80 to 130 km for the E-region mode, and from 100 to 500 km for the F-region mode.",
