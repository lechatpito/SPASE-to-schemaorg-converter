  "description": "The Level 1C Dayside Disk Images are interrupted via stored instrument commands when \n\t  target stars suitable for occultation measurements approach either limb. \n\t  To perform the occultation measurement, the slit mechanism inserts the 1 degree wide occultation (OCC) \n\t  slit at the spectrometer focal plane, and the scan mirrors slew the Field of View to the star. \n\t  The mirror is centered at a 225 km tangent point altitude. Occultations require 6 minutes to \n\t  execute (30 seconds to configure the instrument, 30 seconds for uncertainty in timing and pointing, \n\t  4 minutes for the actual occultation, 30 seconds for uncertainty in timing and pointing, and 30 \n\t  seconds to return to HR slit). Once the occultation is complete, the HR slit is inserted, the scan \n\t  mirror returns to its departure point in the original mapping observation. By choice GOLD is limited \n\t  to performing ~10 occultations a day for most of the year, \n\t  reducing the dayside mapping duty cycle by ~5%.",
