  "description": "For each Carrington rotation, there are two coronal\r\nsynoptic maps of the sun in each of 3 Fe lines (171A, 195A, 284A) and \r\nin He (304A)  These maps are from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope \r\n(EIT) on the SOHO spacecraft.  The two maps for a given day and wavelength \r\ndiffer in that one has latitude on the Y axis and the other has sin(lat).\r\nThere is also a FITS file for each day and wavelength.  As of 01/11/2012, \r\nthe maps spanned Carrington rotations 1911 (start day June 28, 1996) \r\nthrough 2055 (end date April 26, 2006)",
