  "description": "The time-height plots of the three components of wind velocity (zonal, meridional and vertical winds), the echo power and spectral width of five radar beams in the troposphere and lower stratosphere between 2 and 20 km. These data have been taken by the MU radar at Shigaraki in the Shiga prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 136.11E, 385m MSL), which has been operated in the standard observation mode of the troposphere and stratosphere. The file name is (year)(month).(variable).gif for one month plot while (year)(month)(day).(variable).gif for one day plot. The variable abbreviations are wnd, pwr and wdt, which mean wind velocity, echo power and spectral width, respectively. Local time is used for time. The right panels of each time-height plot are 1-day or 1-month average profiles of each parameter as a function of height. Since the screening method for original data (not published) in the previous step to derive the average wind velocity was modified, the new data version (1.02) was released on July 4, 2013.",
