  "description": "Each stack plot is a one week time series of the solar wind full resolution rate. Each horizontal trace is one minute of data. There are 1440 sweeps per day, and 7 days are shown per stack plot. As the solar wind speed changes, the location of the peak in ESA Step (corresponding to an E/Q setting) changes. Sometimes seen to the right of the prominent proton peak is a smaller profile representing solar wind helium (He+2).",
