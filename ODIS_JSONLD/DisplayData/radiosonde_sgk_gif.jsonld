  "description": "Profiles of pressure, temperature, relative humidity, zonal and meridional wind data in the troposphere and lower stratosphere (0-35 km)observed by radiosonde soundings at the Shigaraki MU observatory in the Shiga prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 136.11E, 385m MSL) since September 26, 1986. File names of gif data are composed of (year)(month)(day)(hour)(minute).gif in local time. The value of -999 means missing data. Until 2007 and some of 2008, profiles are only for pressure, temperature and relative humidity.",
