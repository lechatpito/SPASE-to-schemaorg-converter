  "description": "Global distribution of dry air temperature at 15 km calculated by applying full spectrum inversion (FSI) [Jensen et al., 2003] method to COSMIC GPS-RO profiles. The temperature was averaged in a box with +/-5.0 degrees in geographical longitude and latitude and +/-1.0 km height. The horizontal and vertical axes are geographic longitude and latitude, respectively. The color bar is a dry air temperature between -80 and -40 degree C. File name of the height-latitude plot is composed of YYYYMMDD_temperature_2dmap_15.0000km.png. YYYY, MM, and DD indicate year, month, and day, respectively.",
