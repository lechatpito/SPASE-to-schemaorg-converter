  "description": "Wind Waves RAD2, RAD1, and TNR dynamic spectrogram plots with frequency in kHz on the vertical axis and time in UT on the horizontal axis. Each file contains one electric field spectrogram from each of three instruments: RAD1 (radio receiver band 1), RAD2 (radio receiver band 2) and TNR (thermal noise receiver). The intensity values are color coded and are expressed as tlm counts above galactic background for the RAD1 and RAD2 receivers and as dB below a volt per root Hz for the TNR. Each plot spans 24 hours. Above the RAD2 spectrogram are spacecraft GSE coordinates at the beginning and ending of the time period of the plot. RAD1 PLOT RAD1 is the low frequency radio astronomy receiver. It sweeps over the range of 20 to 1040 kHz with as many as 256 channels. However, some of the time the number of channels is restricted to 16 or 32 so that direction of arrival and polarization information can be obtained. RAD2 PLOT RAD2 is the high frequency radio astronomy receiver. It sweeps over the range of 1.075 to 13.825 MHz with as many as 256 channels. However, some of the time the number of channels is restricted to 16 or 32 so that direction of arrival and polarization information can be obtained. TNR PLOT The thermal noise receiver (TNR) is designed to actively track the solar wind plasma frequency. TNR consists of 5 overlapping bands. Each band covers 2 octaves, with the next band beginning at the mid point of the lower band. The overall frequency range is 4 - 256 kHz. Usually the tnr is operated in a mode where the first, third and fifth bands are sampled, but occassionally the instrument is driven by neural network software which tries to pick the one band containing the plasma frequency. At the bottom are panels showing the AGC level of each band and it can be determined from these just which mode of operation exists. The main plot is in the form of a dynamic spectra with intensity shown as a color bar. The units are db below a volt per root Hz. Information on the instrument and antenna status is also provided below the TNR spectrogram.",
