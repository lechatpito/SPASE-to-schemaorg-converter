  "description": "These level 1C movies from the Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) instrument on board the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) mission contains far-ultraviolet (FUV) airglow fluxes in calibrated, geolocated (at a 150-km altitude), and rectified intensities (gridded and binned to a 25 km x 25 km resolution).  Each data set consist of movies with 14 days of mapped images of the log intensities by orbit for one of the 5 wavelengths bands: HI(121.6nm), OI(130.4nm), OI(135.6nm), LBHS(141-152.8nm), and LBHL(167.2-181.2nm)wavelengths, using either a transverse Mercator projection, or a North Polar projection, or a South Polar projection.",
