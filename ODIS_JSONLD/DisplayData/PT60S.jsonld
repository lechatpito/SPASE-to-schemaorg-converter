  "description": "The Spherical Elementary Current (SEC) display data set shows the spherical elementary current equivalent ionospheric currents (mA/m) and amplitude data (J) derived using the SECS technique [Amm and Viljanen, Earth Planets Space, v. 51 pp. 431-440, 1999]. The location of these currents is in geographic coordinates at 10s resolution. The distribution of the current amplitudes is not the same as the equivalent ionospheric currents. The UT and date are obtained from the file name. For more information see Weygand et al. J. Geophys. Res. 116, A03305, doi:10.1029/2010JA016177, 2011.",
