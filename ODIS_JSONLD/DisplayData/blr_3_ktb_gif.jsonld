  "description": "The time-height plots of the three components of wind velocity (zonal, meridional and vertical winds), the echo power and spectral width of five radar beams in the troposphere between 1 and 6 km taken by the boundary layer radar (BLR)-3 at Kototabang, Indonesia (0.20S, 100.32E, 865m MSL). The plots are stored in the gif file named (year)(month).(variable).gif for one month plot or (year)(month)(day).(variable).gif for one day plot. The variable abbreviations are wnd, pwr and wdt, which mean wind velocity, echo power and spectral width, respectively. Local time is used for time. The right panels of each image are 1-day or 1-month average profiles of each parameter as a function of height. The missing data are presented by white color.",
