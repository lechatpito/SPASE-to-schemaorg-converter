  "description": "The time-height plot of horizontal wind data in the middle-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere (70-110 km) estimated from the meteor wind observations at Shigaraki MU Observatory in Shiga Prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 136.11E, 385m MSL). File name of each plot is composed of date and variable abbreviation: Ws(year)(month)(day).(resolution).gif (daily plot), Ws(year)(month).(resolution).gif (monthly plot) and Ws(year).(resolution).gif (yearly plot). The resolution abbreviations are h2t60min00, h2t60min30, h4t60min00 and h4t60min30 (please refer to the readme file of text or netCDF data for details of the resolution abbreviations). These plots are made using the netCDF data of each resolution in time and height. For yearly plot, only the h2t60min00 and h4t60min00 data are used and averaged for each day. The daily average is done if there are more than one valid data in all of the four time zones (0-5, 6-11, 12-17 and 18-24 h).",
