The SWS has monitored and archived solar activity images from Culgoora and Learmonth for more than two decades. They include H-Alpha (2003-2014) and White Light (2004-2013) images from Culgoora, and H-Alpha (2004-2009), GONG H-Alpha (since 2013), GONG White Light (since 2010), and GONG Magnetogram (since 2010) images from Learmonth. Learmonth solar image data are available since 2004-05-31.",
