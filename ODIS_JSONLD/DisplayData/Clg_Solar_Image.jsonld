  "description": "Australia has made major contributions to research in solar physics for several decades. Solar images are a major kind of records of solar activities. The SWS has monitored and archived solar activity images from Culgoora and Learmonth for more than two decades. They include H-Alpha (2003-2014) and White Light (2004-2013) images from Culgoora, and H-Alpha (2004-2009), GONG H-Alpha (since 2013), GONG White Light (since 2010), and GONG Magnetogram (since 2010) images from Learmonth. A new set of three telescopes, which are on a single mount, has installed at Culgoora. Culgoora solar image data are available since 2003-02-01.",
