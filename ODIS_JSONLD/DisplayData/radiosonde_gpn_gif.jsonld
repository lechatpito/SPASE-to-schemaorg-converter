  "description": "Profiles of temperature, relative humidity, zonal and meridional wind data in the troposphere and lower stratosphere (0-40 km) observed by radiosonde soundings at the Pirlangimpi (Garden Point) during Darwin Area Wave Experiment (DAWEX). File names of gif data are composed of nG(Month)(day)(hour).gif in universal time. The DAWEX radiosonde observations were conducted in 2001. These plots are made using the netCDF data. Detailed description of the netCDF data also can be found in the metadata.",
