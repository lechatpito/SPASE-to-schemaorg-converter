  "description": "Stripchart plots from output of the MTSU Dual Dipole Array and JOVE receiver operating at 20.1 MHz. The plots are generated using the Radio-SkyPipe software. The Display Cadence will often vary but 24 Hours is a reasonable maximum value for the timespan of a single plot. The plots depict a single channel of data. The data is presented as Antenna Temperature in units of kiloKelvins. The date and the name of the observatory, MTSU, is usually given across the top of the plot. Time is presented in Universal Time (UT).",
