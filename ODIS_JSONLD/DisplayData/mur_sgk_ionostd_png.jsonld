  "description": "The time-height and time-series plots of the electron and ion temperatures and echo power in the ionosphere between 200 and 1000 km and the height-average ion drift velocities, respectively. These data have been taken by the MU radar at Shigaraki in the Shiga prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 136.11E, 385m MSL), which has been operated in the standard observation mode of the ionosphere. The plots are stored in the png file named (year)(month)(day)_(variable).png. The variable abbreviations are drift, Te_Ti and power, which mean ion drift, electron and ion temperatures, and echo powers of beam 1-4, respectively. The local time is used for time. The electron and ion temperatures are plotted within a range from 200 to 2800 K. The average ion drift velocities between 220 and 450 km include the eight components (the parallel velocities to the beam 1-4 directions, the eastward and northward velocities perpendicular to the magnetic field, the upward velocity parallel to the magnetic field and the vertical velocity). The vertical velocity consists of the eastward and northward components. The azimuth and zenith angles of beam 1-4 are (355, 20), (85, 20), (175, 20) and (265, 20), respectively. The azimuth is defined as a horizontal angle measured anti-clockwise from the geographic north.",
