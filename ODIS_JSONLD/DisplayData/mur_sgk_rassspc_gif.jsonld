  "sdDatePublished": "2016-07-21",
  "description": "The time-height plots of the three components of wind velocity (zonal, meridional and vertical winds) and the temperature in the troposphere between 1.5 and 11.1 km. These data are taken by the MU radar at Shigaraki in the Shiga prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 136.11E, 385m MSL), which has been operated in the special observation mode of the RASS (Radio Acoustic Sounding System). The file name is (year)(month)(day).(variable).gif. The variable abbreviations are uwnd, vwnd, wwnd and temp, which mean zonal, meridional and vertical wind velocity and temperature, respectively. Local time (UT+09:00) is used for time data.",
