  "sdDatePublished": "2020-07-07",
  "description": "This dataset contains two hour duration dynamic spectrogram GIF plots of the DE-1/PWI SFR-A (electric antenna). Each image is a plot of the power spectral density (V^2 m^-2 Hz^-1) of received signal (color scale) as a function of operating frequency (in a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis) and time (horizontal axis). At the top center of each plot is a title indicating the University of Iowa, the instrument, and the date. On the upper left is an indication of the receiver used, the upper right is the orbit number. Immediately below the title is a horizontal bar and the label \"WB\" on the extreme left indicating the time duration when wideband data were acquired. Beneath the time labels on the horizontal axis of the spectrogram are ephemeris data: position of the spacecraft in radial distance (Earth radii), McIlwain L-shell, magnetic local time, and geomagnetic latitude. Overlaid on each image are traces of the electron, hydrogen and oxygen cyclotron frequencies. Running along the left edge of the plot next to the frequency scale is the date represented as two digit year, day of year, hour and minute of the start of the plot.",
