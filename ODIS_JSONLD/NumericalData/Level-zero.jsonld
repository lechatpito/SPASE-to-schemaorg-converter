All of the Data Products for a specific spin are reported as a spin packet that contains a spin header followed by each Data Product. Six Data Products contain instrument parameters or memory dumps. The remaining 182 Data Products contain collapsed and doubly compressed ion counts for specific ions, energy bins, and spin and polar angle bins. The counts can be summed (collapesd) over adjacent energy and spin angle bins. The counts are then converted (compressed) from a 16-bit to an 8-bit integer. A Lossy compression is then applied to the Data Product bytes. The data products reported each spin depend on TIDE's operating modes. NOTE: The only way to read TIDE data products is to use the TIDE processing software.

      "description": "The TIDE instrument recorded high counts centered on two different spin angles and resulting from solar photons. There is one large pulse (centered on the sun direction) and one small pulse (at high spin angles) every spin of the spacecraft, about every 6 s. The ion mask is used to subtract the sun pulse and background noise. Once every other day at a point near apogee where few counts are expected the MCPs are shut down for a couple of superspins (32 spins/superspin) so that only background counts and sun pulses are detected. The count rate data collected during this time are then averaged to get the background mask. The mask file is a binary file that contains an averaged background count for each energy (31), spin angle (32), polar angle (7), and mass (6). From 04/01/96 to 12/07/06, the mask files contain a mask for each of the ions (H+, He+, O+, He++, molecular ions, and Singles). For Total Ions (Stops) data from 12/08/96 to 04/15/08, the mask file is mostly zeros with masks created for H+ (never used) and for Stops. The Stops mask is a 31 x 32 (energy versus spin angle) array stored in channel 3 (polar angle), mass 4. For Stops the rest of the array is zeros.",
