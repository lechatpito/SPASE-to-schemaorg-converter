  "description": "The Cluster Electric Field and Waves (EFW) data available from the Cluster Active Archive include: (1) The instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vectors with time resolution down to 0.1 millisecond, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) The AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; and (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz.  Level 1 is the raw data for reference puprose only and is not accessible on CAA.   Both Level 2 (at 0.2 second and full resolution of 0.04 second)  and Level 3 (4-second resolution) data include spacecraft potential; 3D Electric Field in Inverted Spin Reference 2 system (ISR2);  3D Electric Field in GSE; plasma (ExB) drift velocity in ISR2; and plasma (ExB) drift velocity in GSE.  In addition, Level 2 products include data in burst mode of time resolutions up to 36,000 samples/s: spacecraft potential, 2D electric field data in ISR2 and 3D magnetic field data in ISR2. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz.  \nFor more details, see \"The Cluster Active Archive: Studying the Earth's Space Plasma Environment\", edited by Dr. Harri Laakso, Matthew G. T. T. Taylor, C. Philippe Escoubet.",
