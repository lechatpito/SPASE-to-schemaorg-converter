  "description": "This data set from the POLAR Hot Plasma Analyzer (HYDRA) contains survey electron and proton moments for density, bulk velocity (GSM), and temperature in parallel and perpendicular directions at 13.8-second resolution as determined for s/c potential at 0-20keV. Higher quality data products may be available from the P.I. The direction designations \"parallel,\"\"perpendicular,\" and \"antiparallel\" refer to the magnetic field and indicate sample averaging over pitch-angle ranges of 0-30, 75-105, and 150-180 degrees.
