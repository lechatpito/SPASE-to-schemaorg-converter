  "description": "The observation data in the mesosphere (60-100 km) taken by the MU radar at Shigaraki in Shiga Prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 136.11E, 385m MSL), which has been operated in the standard observation mode of the mesosphere. The data are stored in the netCDF (network Common Data Form) file named (year)(month)(day).wnd.nc (wind data) and (year)(month)(day).nc (other data). The azimuth and zenith angles of beam 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are (0, 0), (0, 10), (90, 10), (180, 10) and (270, 10), respectively, in unit of degree. The time interval of data is the same as that of the original data, but the wind data are 1 hour average. The value of 999 contained in the wind data means missing value. The information of condition code and flag can be found in the README (http://www.rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp/mu/mesosphere/note/README_mur_mesosphere_data.html and http://www.rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp/mu/mesosphere/note/README_mur_mesosphere_wind_data.html).",
