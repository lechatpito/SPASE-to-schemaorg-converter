  "sdDatePublished": "2022-04-27",
  "description": "This data set contains Interball-Tail CORALL  ion differential fluxes. The  sectors overlapping are excluded and absolute values of differential fluxes for virtual polar sectors are provided. The number of virtual sectors depends on the statistics. For good enough statistics five virtual polar sectors [30\u00b0-54\u00b0, 54\u00b0-78\u00b0, 78\u00b0-102\u00b0, 102\u00b0-126\u00b0, 126\u00b0-150\u00b0] are resolved. For poor statistics - only three [30\u00b0-70\u00b0, 70\u00b0-110\u00b0, 110\u00b0-150\u00b0].",
