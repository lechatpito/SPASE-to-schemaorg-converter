  "description": "This data set contains Skylab UV solar EUV data provided by the Principal Investigator. The data consist of both FITS data files and raw data files, contained in two subdirectories: /fits_data and /raw_data. The subdirectory /fits_data contains fits data files created in 2012 by copying from CDs (Compact Disks) which were in turn written by Mathieu Hirtzig at CfA in 2001 from SKYLAB-S055 data stored at the time on tape at CfA.  These data are stored in 22 subdirectories (/fits_data/CD01 through /fits_data/CD22), each of which is a copy of one of the 22 CD's. Each of the subdirectories contains an identical\r\nsub-subdirectory named /README_S055, which contains a number of files some of which may be helpful in examining the data. It is recommended that those unfamiliar with the S055 experiment look at the file README_S055.txt for background, as well as other files in the README_S055 sub-subdirectory, some of which provide useful auxilliary information.  The subdirectory /raw_data contains the raw data from which the fits data files were created.  This is probably of limited use, but is included for archival purposes.",
