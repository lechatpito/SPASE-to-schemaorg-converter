  "description": "Plasma density derived from individual spacecraft \npotential measurements on one illuminated probe. The derivation additionally \nuses low time resolution estimates of the plasma density from either RPCLAP or \nRPCMIP (changes over time).  The data here are derived from the LAP \nVsc proxy known as U_SC which is available over all the mission, and \nare calibrated to MIP density values after 2014-12-31. Before this period the MIP \ndensity detections were scarce since densities usually were low, so the LAP \nsweep parameter N_E from ASW dataset was used for the calibration of U_SC to N_ED. \nThis is a good calibration source precisely when MIP data are scarce, as low plasma density \nmeans low s/c potential, meaning that the otherwise very negative spacecraft potential here \ndoes not prevent plasma electrons from reaching the Langmuir probes.\n\nThis is a preliminary data set which will be replaced by another in a few months.\n ",
