  "description": "Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM) AC Magnetic Field (32 samples/s), Level 2, Survey Mode Data. The tri-axial Search-Coil Magnetometer with its associated preamplifier measures three-dimensional magnetic field fluctuations. The analog magnetic waveforms measured by the SCM are digitized and processed inside the Digital Signal Processor (DSP), collected and stored by the Central Instrument Data Processor (CIDP) via the Fields Central Electronics Box (CEB). Prior to launch, all SCM Flight models were calibrated by LPP team members at the National Magnetic Observatory, Chambon-la-Foret (Orleans). Once per orbit, each SCM transfer function is checked thanks to the onboard calibration signal provided by the DSP. The SCM is operated for the entire MMS orbit in survey mode. Within scientific Regions Of Interest (ROI), burst mode data are also acquired as well as high speed burst mode data. This SCM data set corresponds to the AC magnetic field waveforms in nanoTesla and in the GSE frame. The SCM instrument paper can be found at http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-014-0096-9 and the SCM data product guide at https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/public/datasets/fields/.",
