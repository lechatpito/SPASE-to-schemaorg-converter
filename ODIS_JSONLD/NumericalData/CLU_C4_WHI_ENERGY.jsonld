  "description": "This dataset contains the electric field power spectral density observed by WHISPER on Cluster-4.\nCompared to the WHI_NATURAL and WHI_ACTIVE datasets, the particularity of this dataset is that bandwidth of the measurements is large, so as to optimise the time resolution.\nThe dataset includes data obtained both when the sounder is active and passive (natural waves).\nThe support data includes : \n    a flag to indicate sounder activity the number of elementary spectra which have been summed. Individual spectral are acquired every 13.33 ms, and these spectra are averaged to improve the statistics.\n    an indicator of how many, if any, of the individual spectra were saturated.",
