  "name": "Horizontal wind data in the middle-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere estimated from the meteor wind radar observations at Shigaraki (text format)",
  "sdDatePublished": "2016-07-21",
  "description": "The horizontal wind data in the middle-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere (70-110 km) estimated from the meteor wind observations at Shigaraki MU Observatory in Shiga Prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 136.11E, 385m MSL). The wind data are calculated from the original observation data with a weighting function. They are stored in the text file named Ws(year)(month)(day).(resolution).txt or Ws(year)(month).(resolution).txt. The resolution abbreviations are h2t60min00, h2t60min30, h4t60min00 and h4t60min30. For example, the h2t60 means weighted average with Gaussian factors over +/-2 km in height and +/-60 minutes in time. The min00 shows that the center of the Gaussian window corresponds to 00 minute of every hour. The intervals of the wind data are every 2km and 60 minutes. The text file includes year, day of year, time (local time), height, zonal and meridional winds, standard deviations of zonal and meridional winds, number of meteors used for the weighted average of the horizontal wind and two internal values.",
