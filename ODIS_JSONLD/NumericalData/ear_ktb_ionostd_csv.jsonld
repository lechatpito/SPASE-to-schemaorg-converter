  "description": "The field-aligned irregularity (FAI) observation data in the equatorial ionosphere taken by the equatorial atmosphere radar (EAR) at Kototabang, Indonesia (0.20S, 100.32E, 865m MSL). This FAI observation mode covers a wide altitude range from 80 to 600 km in the ionosphere (D-region (below 90 km), E-region (90-150 km), and F-region (above 150 km)). The data are stored in the CSV (Comma Separated Values) file named (year)(month)(day).(observation parameter).(variable)(beam number).csv. The variable abbreviations are dpl, wdt, dpl, and pn, which mean radial Doppler velocity, echo power, spectral width and noise level for each beam number, respectively. Details of the parameters and beam numbers are described in the EAR-FAI homepage (http://www.rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ear/data-fai/index.html). The numbers of the first and second lines of each file represent ranges and heights, respectively, and the third and below are observational local date and time (year/month/day hour:minute) which corresponds to the center time of averaging period and data at each range and height. The value of -999 means missing data. The time resolution depends on each observation parameter. The noise level is the height-averaged value.",
