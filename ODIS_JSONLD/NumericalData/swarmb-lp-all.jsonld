They include\n \n* estimates of the electron density, using the ion current\n* estimates of the electron temperature and spacecraft potential  from both probes\n* flags of informative character or indicating quality issues of data\n* estimates of the electron temperature using a combination of the results from both probes, applying a modified, potentially improved blending algorithm compared to the present L1b algorithm \n\nThe data are intended for users with some experience and understanding of Langmuir probe data.\n ",
