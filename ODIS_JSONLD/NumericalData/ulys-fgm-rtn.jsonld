  "description": "This data set contains high resolution samples at about one-second \n                intervals of the interplanetary magnetic field measured by the Ulysses \n                Magnetic Field experiment. Field vector components are given in units of \n                nanoteslas and in RTN coordinates, where R is the sun-s/c axis, T is the \n                cross product of the solar rotation axis and R, and T is the cross product \n                of R and T. The field magnitudes in nT are averages of scalar magnitudes \n                at higher time resolution. Times are computed at the mid-point of each \n                averaging interval and expressed in Spacecraft Event Time - UT (SCET-UT). \n                Data gaps have not been flagged in any way - if there were no available \n                data in a particular hour then there is no data record for that hour. No \n                data from the Feb. 1992 encounter with Jupiter are included. Each file \n                includes one day of data.
