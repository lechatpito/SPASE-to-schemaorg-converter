  "description": "Wind Waves Thermal Noise Receiver Temporal Series \nThese are calibrated data presented as a temporal series. Each record consists on a unique spectrum (given in \u00b5V^2 / Hz) made with 96 frequencies.\nIn modes 0, 1 and 4 the number of channels per band is increased to 32 by interpolation. The interpolated frequencies are located by the odd indexes.\nIn mode 4, spectra issued from the TNR B are ignored. In mode 2 and 3, data are not altered.\nIf the cycle is in state fixed tune (event_state = 1) , then only 32 values are defined. With respect to the band sweeped, the following values are defined:\nBand: Index of defined values\nA : 0 to 31\n B : 16 to 47\n C : 32 to 63\n D : 48 to 79\n E : 64 to 95\nIf the cycle is in state ABCDE (event_state=2), then band B and D are ignored, while in state ACE (event_state=3) all data are available.",
