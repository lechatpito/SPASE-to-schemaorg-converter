  "name": "Horizontal wind data in the equatorial mesosphere and lower thermosphere estimated from the meteor wind radar observations at Serpong (NetCDF format)",
  "sdDatePublished": "2016-07-21",
  "description": "The horizontal wind data in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (70-112 km) estimated from the meteor wind radar observations at Serpong, one of the south-west suburbs of Jakarta, Indonesia (6.36S, 106.65E, 50m MSL). The wind data are calculated from the original observation data with a weighting function. They are stored in the netCDF (network Common Data Form) file named jkt(year)(month).(resolution).nc or jkt(year)(month)(day).(resolution).nc. The resolution abbreviations are h2t60min00 and h4t240min00. For example, the h2t60 means weighted average of the horizontal windwith Gaussian factors over +/-2 km in height and +/-60 minutes in time. In this case,the number of meteors stands for that of data points included in the height and time window. The min00 shows that the center of the Gaussian window corresponds to 00 minute of every hour. The intervals of the wind data are every 2 km and 60 minutes. The netCDF file includes time, height, zonal and meridional winds, standard deviations of zonal and meridional winds, and number of meteors.",
