  "description": "This data set contains energy spectra of ions  from the 1st telescope (1P) of the DOK-2 instrument on board the Interball-Tail spacecraft.\n\nThe detector 1P was directed at 180\u00b0 to the satellite spin axis. Energy spectra of ions were measured at 56 channels in the range 20 to 850 keV. Selected 56 energy channels are identified by numbers (1 - 56).",
