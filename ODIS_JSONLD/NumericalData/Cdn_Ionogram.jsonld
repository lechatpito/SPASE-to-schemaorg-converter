  "description": "Ionograms are an image of frequency versus time delay (virtual height) of HF echoes from the ionosphere recorded by an ionosonde. An ionosonde is a swept frequency HF pulsed radar used to monitor the ionosphere. SWS WDC has archived ionogram data from 26 stations, 12 of them are still active at present. An IPS 5D ionosonde has been sounding since 31/10/1995 at Camden. The 5D vertical sounding ionosondes normally sweep in frequency from about 1 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 5D is 5kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale. Every five minutes, a Ionogram data file is recorded, cleaned and the cleaned ionogram is transfered to SWS Sydney head office for autoscaling and further analysis. The raw ionogram file is recorded in a DVD monthly, which will be posted to Sydney SWS head office every month. During 01/06/1997 to 15/04/2003, Camden also had an IPS 4c ionosonde. During 23/02/1999 to 21/12/2004, an IPS 4D ionosonde. During 01/04/1991 to 31/10/1999, an IPS 5a ionosonde. and During 04/07/1997 to 18/11/2014, a CADI ionosonde. The IPS 5D ionosonde was stopped in 02/03/2018 and replaced by an IPS 5F ionosonde since 01/02/2018. SWS WDC archives all raw ionogram files and cleaned ionogram files. The Camden digital clean ionogram data is available since 01/04/1991, and digital raw ionogram data since 23/02/1999. The Camden scaled hourly ionospheric data include parameters of foF2, foF1, FoE, foEs, fbEs, fmin, fxl, f'scaling F/s, M(3000)F2, h'F2, h'F, h'E, h'Es, h'Scaling R/S and Type Es. They are avalable from 01/01/1980 to 31/12/1984. The Camden median data of foF2 and M(3000)F2 are available from 11/1980 to 12/1984 and the month of 05/1998.\r\n      ",
