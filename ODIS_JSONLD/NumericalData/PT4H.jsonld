  "description": "This set of heliospheric data in ASCII contains measurements of energetic particles by the KS-18 instrument onboard the third Russian space probe of the Zond series at heliocentric distances larger than 1 AU.  It includes proton flux intensities at >30 MeV energy from Sun (gas-discharge counter) and at 1-5 MeV energy arriving from the direction perpendicular to the Sun-spacecraft line (stand-alone SSD sensor of 35 micron Si). Subdirectory /lownoise contains the same measured data but in its extra-rectified variant.  Besides the trajectory data in two coordinate systesms, there are overview plots in GIF.",
