  "description": "RadioJOVE Multiple Frequency Data Product. This data set consists of observations made at the Hawk's Nest Radio Astronomy Observatory (HNRAO) using a Terminated Folded Dipole and an SDRPlay receiver. These data are generated using the Radio Sky Spectrograph software. The data set consists of one channel of data. A RCP and a LCP data product are produced.\n\nThese data may include observations of Solar Radio Bursts, Jupiter decametric radio emission, or Galactic Background radio emission.\n\nThe Radio-Sky Spectrograph produced datafiles consist of a fixed length header and a variable length note. The data portion of the file for single channel data consists of an 8 byte timestamp using the VisualBasic 6 date format (days since 1 Jan 1900) followed by one 8 byte data values this pattern repeats until the end of file. More details can be found in the Data File Structure document on the Radio-SkyPipe help page (see Information URL).\n\nThese data are submitted to the RadioJOVE Archive and to the PDS/PPI archive at UCLA.",
