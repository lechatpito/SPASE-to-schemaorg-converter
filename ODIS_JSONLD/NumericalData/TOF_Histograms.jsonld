  "description": "Each table (CSV file) captures the numbers \nof counts of arriving energetic neutral atoms, as integrated \nover a full 8-day orbit, for a single IBEX-Lo energy step, \nfor one of three categories of species (hydrogen, oxygen plus\ncarbon, and hydrogen plus oxygen plus carbon, the latter \ntwo being labelled \"Oxygen\" and \"All,\" respectively in file\nnames).  Numbers of counts are given in 1024 0.33-nanosecond \nTOF bins ranging from 0-0.33 ns to 339.67-340 ns.  Each table \nis CSV-formatted Excel.  Each subdirectory is for a given \nenergy band and has the tables (files) for each of several \norbits for each of the three species categories.",
