  "description": "This set of 30-s averaged fluxes are derived from measurements made by all 4 instruments (HILT, LICA, MAST and PET) onboard the Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX). Each file covers one full day of 30-s averaged fluxes of cosmic rays from selected channels from all experiments. There are 156 variables per record, and the file size is about 4 MB. After an extensive list of ancillary data, the particle fluxes follow. (1) LICA provides fluxes of electrons and protons in the energy range of about >0.7 Mev, of (mainly) helium in the range 0.49-8.3 MeV/nucleon. (2) HILT provides fluxes of helium from two channels, 4-9 and 9-38, of Z > 5 from two channels, 8.2-42 and 41-220 MeV/n. (3) MAST provides fluxes protons (mainly) in 5-12 MeV range, of helium in 8-15, and of Z > 5 in 19.3-22.8, 22.8-31.0, 31.0-51.7, 51.7-76.2, 76.2-113, 113-156 MeV/n. (4) PET provides fluxes of electrons in the ranges 1.5-6, and 2.5-14 MeV, and of (mainly) protons in 19-27 MeV/n. All flux values are accompanied by their standard deviations and quality flags. The fluxes available in this file are from a subset of (30-s resolution) rate channels. Energy spectra are assembled by pick-and-choose across instrument boundaries; an example is the eight-element array of Z>3 fluxes that have contributions from all four instruments",
