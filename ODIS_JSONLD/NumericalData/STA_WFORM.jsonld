  "description": "This dataset gives access to waveforms with Langmuir waves signature. They were observed by STEREO-A/WAVES TDS instrument from December 2006 to August 2014, thus covering observation in the Earth environment (at the beginning of the mission) and the interplanetary medium.\nThe dataset is provided as zip compressed files which contain:\n  *  A CDF file with IMPACT magnetic field components in spacecraft and variance frame (3 min interval around the time of the Langmuir event)\n   * A CDF file with the three components electric waveform in the local frame (B, BxV, Bx(BxV))\n   * A PDF file which represents CDF data graphically (that is, the waveform and the magnetic configuration at the time of the Langmuir event).\nAll data are in physical units and calibrated.",
