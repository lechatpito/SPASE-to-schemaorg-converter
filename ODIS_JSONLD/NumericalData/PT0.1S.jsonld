  "description": "This product contains high-resolution (0.1 s) magnetic field data for intervals of the closest approach of the Vega 2 spacecraft to Halley comet. Magnetic field and position data are in the cometocentric solar ecliptic (CSE) coordinate system. CSE coordinate system for the spacecraft position: * Origin is at comet position, x-axis from comet to the Sun, z-axis to ecliptic northpole. * The (x,y)-plane is parallel to the ecliptic plane. CSE coordinate system for the magnetic field data: * Axes are parallel to the CSE system for the position. * This coordinate system is valid only for very short time, about 4 hours around the closest approach of the spacecraft to the comet, since for a larger angular distance of the spacecraft from the comet, the direction to the Sun from both objects will be different.",
