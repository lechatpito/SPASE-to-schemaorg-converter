  "description": "Data from https://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/pub. PLASTIC has a ~1 minute energy per charge (E/Q) cadence in which the electrostatic\nanalyzer (ESA) steps through 128 logarithmically spaced E/Q steps from ~80 keV/e,\ndown to ~0.3 keV/e.\n\nProton bulk parameters provided here (speed, density, thermal) are derived from a 1D\nMaxwellian fit to a single detector rate (no coincidence required), and are corrected for\nbackground and dead time. The N/S angle is derived from a peak fitting to the N/S\n(deflection) rate bins of the same rate. The E/W angle is derived from a separate double\ncoincidence rate. \n\nThe proton velocity components are corrected for spacecraft aberration\nand are derived using the N/S and E/W angles.\n",
