  "description": "This set of key parameters from the SESAME FPI (Satellite Experiments Simultaneous with Antarctic MEasurements Fabry-Perot Interferometer) contains horizontal velocity from line-of-sight velocity at 30-deg elevation in South and East directions, with an indicator to show emission wavelength (558 or 630 nm). Data are taken from April to September in 30-min resolution. Please see references: (1) Dudeney, J. R. et. al., Satellite Experiments Simultaneous with Antarctic Measurements (SESAME), Space Science Reviews, Volume 71, Issue 1-4, pp. 705-742, 1995, (2) Nature, 317, p45 1985, and (3) R.D.Stewart, PhD Thesis, Univ of Ulster, 1986.",
