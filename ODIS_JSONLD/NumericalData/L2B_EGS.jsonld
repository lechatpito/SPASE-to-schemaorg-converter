  "description": "The EUV Grating Spectrograph (EGS) aboard SEE performs measurements of the Sun for about 3 minutes every orbit (97 minutes) which usually gives 14-15 measurements per day. 4x per year, in-between direct solar measurements, the SEE instrument has opportunities to observe the solar irradiance transmitted through the atmosphere. The Level 2B EGS Occultation data is time averaged over each measurement and divided by the average of the previous and next solar observations. The EGS resolution is about 0.4 nm, but the data product is sampled at 0.1 nm with valid data ranging from ~27-190 nm.",
