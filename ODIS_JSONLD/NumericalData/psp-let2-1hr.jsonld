  "description": "    \n             LET1 and LET2 are similar in design to the HET, cylinders containing a central stack of detector disks and positionally \n             sensitive detectors at the ends. LET1 has 1000-micron thick detector disks in the central stack, except for the end disks \n             which are 500 microns. At the front of the cylinder, separate from the central stack, is a 12 micron thick disk and then a \n             25 micron disk. The back of the detector has the same arrangement. The front of the detector also has a thin window \n             (~3 micron silicon equivalent). The 12, 25, and 500 micron thick disks are all separated into five active elements in the \n             same way as the HET for positional determination. LET2 is similar to LET1 but does not have the end 12, 25, and 500 micron disks.\n             The Low-Energy Telescopes can measure protons and heavy ions from approximately \n             1 MeV to greater than 20 MeV/n and electrons from about 0.5 MeV to 2 MeV. LET2 telescope, unlike LET1 and HET, is single sided, with its only side called C, oriented at +135\u00b0 from the sunward direction.\n         ",
