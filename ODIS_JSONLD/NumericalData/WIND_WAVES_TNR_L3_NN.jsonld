  "description": "This data set contains WIND WAVES TNR L3 Neural Network Data\nTwo methods have been used to derive the electron density from the quasi-thermal noise measurements of the Waves Thermal Noise Receiver.\nThis data set identifies the plasma frequency by use of a neural network.\n They give the plasma frequency in kHz and the electronic density in cm-3 as computed by the ground neural network. Data are organized as temporal series with a time resolution of 5 seconds.",
