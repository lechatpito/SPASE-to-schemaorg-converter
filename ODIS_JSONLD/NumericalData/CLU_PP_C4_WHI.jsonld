  "description": "This data set contains the Cluster 4 WHISPER Prime Parameters  :  the electron density and plasma wave spectral density integrated over the frequency range, plus the status of operations.\n\nCaveats\n\nThe WHISPER sounders operate on a duty cycle, so the electron density is sampled on neither a continuous nor a constant basis. This duty cycle covers situations from continuous active modes with one sounding occurring typically every 1-3 seconds, to natural mode operation only when no sounding is performed, and hence no density is provided for long periods. When many density values are available during a PPDB/SPDB interval, the averaged value is provided. When no value is available during such a time interval, the fill value (no data) is given. For example, in the typical WEC normal mode, a double sounding occurs over 3 s every 52 s. Thus, for PPDB, a density value, averaged over 2 spectra, is available followed by 6 fill values. For the SPDB, 2 averaged values are available 52 s apart. They are averaged for the SPDB slot.",
