  "name": "Wind and temperature data in the troposphere estimated from the RASS (Radio Acoustic Sounding System) observation of the MU radar at Shigaraki (CSV format)",
  "sdDatePublished": "2016-07-21",
  "description": "The observation data in the troposphere (1.5-11.1 km) taken by the MU radar at Shigaraki in the Shiga prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 136.11E, 385m MSL), which has been operated in the special observation mode of the RASS (Radio Acoustic Sounding System). The data are stored in the CSV (Comma Separated Values) file named (year)(month)(day).(variable).csv. The variable abbreviations are uwnd, vwnd, wwnd, and temp, which mean zonal, meridional and vertical wind velocities, and temperature, respectively. The numbers of the first line of each file represent altitudes, and the second and below are observational local date and time (day-month-year hour:minute:second) and data at each altitude. The value of 999 means missing data.",
