  "description": "This set of key parameters from the SESAME (Satellite Experiments Simultaneous with Antartic MEasurements) ground-based experiment contains ionospheric parameters that are derived from quarter-hourly ionograms. The three parameters include the lowest plasma frequency recorded and the highest plasma frequency recorded from the E-region (MHz), and the highest plasma frequency recorded from the F-region (MHz).
