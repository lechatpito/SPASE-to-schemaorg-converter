  "description": "The electron density measurements Ne are given in cm-3 and the given acquisition time for each value is dependant on three different measurement methods (flagged by 0,1 or 2). Ne_min and Ne_max stands for errors bars on the density measurements (which are also strongly depending on the measurements methods)\n\n    The method #0 corresponds to densities deduced from the upper hybrid frequency peak detection, in the HF band of the URAP/RAR receiver (firstly published in Hoang et al., Planet. Space Sci.,Vol. 41, No. 11/12, pp. 1011-1020, 1993, and references therein). The given acquisition time is the elapsed time (UT) of the sweeping receiver at the f_uh peak acquisition.\n    The method #1 corresponds to density obtained by the minimum chi-square fitting of theoritical dispersion curves of Bernstein modes to the experimental dispersion curves derived from the URAP/RAR spectra, Ne and Te being the two free fitted parameters (Moncuquet et al., J. Geophys. Res., 100, 21697-21708 , 1995 and references therein); The given acquisition time for each density measurement is the elapsed time (UT) at mid-time of the whole spectrum acquisition (the acquisition duration of a whole spectrum is 128s). In this case, the determination of Ne and Te are synchronized , but they are not independently determined.\n    The method #2 corresponds to density obtained from detection of Bernstein \"fQ\" frequencies (Moncuquet et al.,J. Geophys. Res., 102, 2373-2379, 1997 and references therein). The given acquisition time is the elapsed time (UT) of the sweeping receiver at the lowest fQ acquisition. \n           ",
