  "description": "This data set contains WIND WAVES Thermal Noise Receiver 60-second Averaged Data (Range 4 - 256 kHz, number of channels 96)\nExperimental data have been re-processed at LESIA from 60-second averaged data produced by the GSFC team at NASA. They are presented as temporal series. Each record consists on an averaged spectrum (given in \u00b5V^2/Hz).",
