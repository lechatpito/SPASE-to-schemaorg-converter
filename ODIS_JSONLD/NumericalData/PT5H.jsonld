  "description": "This data set holds half-orbit (~5 hour) resolution \nproton distributions (19 5-deg equatorial pitch angles vs. 24 energies) \nfrom the Proton Telescope (PROTEL) on the CRRES spacecraft.  \nThe energy range covered is 1-100 MeV.  These data are developed from \nthe 1-min insitu pitch angle distributions by assigning each 5-deg bin \nin pitch angle a corresponding McIlwain L value and then by mapping the \ninsitu pitch angle distribution to the equator, into 0.05-wide L bins, \nassuming first adiabatic invariant conservation.  The mapping yields \nequivalent equatorial pitch angles.  Flux data for a given half-orbit, \ngiven 0.05-wide L bin,  given equatorial pitch angle and given energy bin\nare then averaged.  Data records are for a given half-orbit and given\nL bin; each record contains averaged fluxes vs. equatorial pitch angle\nand energy.  The data are in SGI(UNIX) binary format.  Read software\nis contained within the companion documentation.",
