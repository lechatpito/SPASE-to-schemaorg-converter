  "description": "The geomagnetic auroral electrojet index at 1-min time resolution, derived at World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto, Kyoto University. The real-time Auroral Electrojet (AE) indices are only for monitoring, diagnostics and forcasting purposes. Since the values are derived from unverified raw data, they may contain inacuracies. These data will be replaced by provisional and final AE index at later dates. Users are advised to use final/provisional AE index for analyses.",
