  "description": "This data sets contains spacecraft attitude (roll and offpointing from SPICE kernels), distance from Sun in AU and RTN coordinates. \n The RTN frame is defined as follows :\n    R axis points from the Sun to the spacecraft.\n    T = Omega x R, where Omega is the Sun's rotation axis.\n    N = R x T.\nThe XYZ or spacecraft frame (also referred to as SC) is defined as follows for Parker Solar Probe :\n    Z axis corresponds to the satellite axis (and its arm) and points towards the Sun. When PSP is facing the Sun, Z = -R.\n    X is normally included in the ecliptic plane, with X = Z x Omega, when PSP is facing the Sun.\n    Y is normally perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, pointing towards the South. PSP's solar panels are oriented along the Y axis.\n\nThe data file with position is in CDF format. Records are arranged chronologically, with 1 min time resolution. One record contains :\nEpoch (Y-m-d H:M:S.000000000 format), cos_roll, cos_offpointing, rad_AU (AU), R value (m), T value (m), N value (m)\nwith :\n    Epoch : Time of the record in TT2000 format, exactly in the kernels. This time corresponds to nanoseconds since 1 Jan 2000 12:00:00 with leap seconds included.\n    cos_roll : Cosine of roll angle, i.e. angle between X and T axis (from (XYZ) and (RTN) frames). This angle mainly varies during satellite roll operations, which are carried out several times per orbit to calibrate the MAG fluxgates.\n    cos_offpointing : Cosine of offpointing angle, i.e. angle between Z and R axis. This angle is important for determining when the instruments on the boom are sunlit. Off-pointing primarily occurs when the spacecraft is away from the Sun.\n    rad_AU : Parker Solar Probe-Sun distance in AU.\n    R, T and N values (in m) of Parker Solar Probe in (RTN) frame.\n\nAttitude data, PSP-Sun distance and PSP ephemeris are computed from SPICE kernels (see the CDAWEB Data Center  https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/psp/ephemeris/spice/).",
