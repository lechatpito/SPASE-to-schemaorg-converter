  "description": "This data set contains  Parker Solar Probe FIELDS Level 3 Simplified Quasi-Thermal Noise data, derived from power spectra (10.5 kHz to 1.7 MHz) acquired by the low-frequency receiver (LFR) of the Radio Frequency Spectrometer (RFS) when connected to V1V2 dipole antenna. \nThe technique of QTN spectroscopy consists of using the power spectrum of the voltage induced on an electric antenna by the particle quasi-thermal motion, measured by a radio receiver connected to an electric antenna. The signature of the electrons is a line at the electron plasma frequency, which leads to the total electron density (proportionnal to the square of electron plasma frequency), whereas the shape of the line reveals the electron kinetic temperature, as well as its thermal (core) and suprathermal components. \nFor more information on the QTN spectroscopy, please see : Moncuquet, M. et al. (2020), First in-situ measurements electron density and temperature from quasi-thermal noise spectroscopy with Parker Solar Probe/FIELDS, The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, Volume 246, p.44, doi:10.3847/1538-4365/ab5a84/\nNo data available for encounter E11. Due to operational issues, RFS-LFR was stopped from February 23 to February 27 2022, with a perihelion on February 25, so most of the SQTN processing was not possible for this encounter.",
