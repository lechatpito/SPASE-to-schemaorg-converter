  "description": "The daily netCDF files at GATS, Inc., hold level 2 SOFIE (Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment) data. These include primary absorber mixing ratios (CO2, CH4, NO,H2O, O3), 10 aerosol extinction profiles, uncertainity profiles for mixing ratios and extinctions, 83 km measurement lat./long., Temperatures, Pressures, Time, [0.150 km sampling, 150km to 3.0km, 30 profiles/day]. Vertical resolutions are 1km for gases and for polar mesospheric clouds, and .LT.3.5 km for temperatures and pressures.",
