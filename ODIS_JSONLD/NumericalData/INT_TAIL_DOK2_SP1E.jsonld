  "description": "This data set contains energy spectra of electrons from the 1st telescope (1E) of the DOK-2 instrument on board the Interball-Tail spacecraft.\n\nThe detector 1E was directed at 180\u00b0 to the satellite spin axis. Energy spectra of electrons were measured at 55 channels in the range 27 to 400 keV. Selected 55 energy channels are identified by numbers (1 - 55).",
