  "description": "This data set contains the  power spectral density of magnetic field fluctuations computed by onboard FFTs by the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) from from MMS-3 SCM waveforms during fast survey modes between 0 and 8192 Hz. Their nominal time resolution is 2 s, and nominal number of frequency channels is 56 with logarithmic frequency scale.\nThis product is computed in space from individual components that are not synchronized to the 1 second pulse. Therefore, the timing between channels can be inaccurate by a fraction of a second. The samples times are interval start times taken from the x component.\nSCM1 (spin plane component, -x SCM sensor) component magnetic power spectral density.\nSCM2 (spin plane component, -z SCM sensor) component magnetic power spectral density.\nSCM3 (spin axis component, -y SCM sensor) component magnetic power spectral density.\nOmni-directional magnetic power spectral density: square root of the sum of the squares of 3 components.",
