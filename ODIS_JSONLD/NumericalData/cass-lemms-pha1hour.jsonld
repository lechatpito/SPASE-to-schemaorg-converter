  "description": "One hour average particle intensity data for PHA (Pulse Height Analysis) ion and electron channels.\n            There are three types of channels included in these averages: the A channels, the E channels and the F1 channels. The A channels measure ions,\n mostly protons. The E and F1 channels measure electrons. For the A channels, channel indices 8 through 62 are present\n    (energies of 26-758 keV). For the E channels, indices 15 to 62 (20-410\n    keV), and for F1, 26 through 59 (206-1717 keV).",
