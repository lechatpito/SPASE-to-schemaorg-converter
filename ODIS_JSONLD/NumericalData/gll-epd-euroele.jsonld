In this mode, the count rates are \n               accumulated during around 1.25 second. The full opening angle of the EPD telescopes \n               are relatively narrow, between 15\u00b0 and 18\u00b0, and the acquisition period is very short compared \n               to the rotational spin period of Galileo. Counts and fluxes obtained with the Record \n               acquisition mode can therefore be considered as directional flux measurements. \n               The local and equatorial pitch angles that are given are for the particles observed by the \n               center of the telescope viewing cones. The motor that rotates the EPD telescopes around an \n               axis perpendicular to the spin axis of Galileo can have eight different step positions, \n               from 0 to 7. \n               \nData are extracted from the text file named 'galileo_epd_calibrated_low_res_v18.txt' \nproduced and provided by JHU/APL and publicly available at \nhttp://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/Galileo_EPD/latest_calibrated_data/. \nIt is highly recommended to read the 'readme_v19.docx' document also available at the previous \nlink before using this dataset.
