  "description": "Ionograms are an image of frequency versus time delay (virtual height) of HF echoes from the ionosphere recorded by an ionosonde. An ionosonde is a swept frequency HF pulsed radar used to monitor the ionosphere. SWS WDC has archived ionogram data from 26 stations, 12 of them are still active at present. An CADI (Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosonde) ionosonde has been sounding since 30/11/1999 at Casey. The CADI vertical sounding ionosondes normally sweep in frequency from about 1 to 20 MHz. Three standard sweeps are provided: low resolution (100 frequencies), medium resolution (200 frequencies), high resolution (400 frequencies). The step size may be selected to be linear or logarithmic. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale. Height range up to 512 km (to be increased to 1000 km) with 6 km resolution. Every five minutes, a Ionogram data file is recorded, cleaned and the cleaned ionogram is transfered to SWS Sydney head office for autoscaling and further analysis. The raw ionogram file is recorded in a DVD monthly, which will be posted to Sydney SWS head office every month. During 07/02/1993 to 08/10/2001, Casey also had an Lowell ionosonde. SWS WDC archives all raw ionogram files and cleaned ionogram files. The Casey digital clean ionogram data is available since 25/11/1997, and digital raw ionogram data since 07/02/1993. The Casey scaled hourly ionospheric data include parameters of foF2, foF1, FoE, foEs, fbEs, fmin, fxl, f'scaling F/s, M(3000)F2, h'F2, h'F, h'E, h'Es, h'Scaling R/S and Type Es. They are avalable since 01/01/1957. The Casey median data of foF2 and M(3000)F2 are available since 07/1957.\r\n      ",
