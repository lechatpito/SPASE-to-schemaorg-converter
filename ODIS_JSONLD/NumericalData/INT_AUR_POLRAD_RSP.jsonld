  "sdDatePublished": "2022-04-27",
  "description": "This data set contains calibrated dynamic spectra of the Auroral Kilometric Radiation from the Interball-Auroral POLRAD RSP instrument. The data consist of receiver frequency sweeps, containing power intensities of radio emission at consecutive frequency steps staring from the highest and ending on the lowest (which is always 4 kHz), and information on the instrument status.\n\nThe following operations have been applied to raw data in order to produce the available data:\n\n- application of transfer functions from telemetry data to square input voltages for each receiver channel,\n\n- conversion to power density units using formulae for a short electric dipole in vacuum (level 2).\n\n- visualisation of wave dynamic spectra for each of 3 orthogonal antennae (channel 1 = antenna Y, channel 2 = antenna Z, and channel 3 = antenna X).",
