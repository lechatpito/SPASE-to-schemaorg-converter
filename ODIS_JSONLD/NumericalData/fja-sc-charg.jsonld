Such a payload package is, of course, also suitable for spacecraft charging studies. \n                Numerous surface charging events did indeed occur with negative charging levels as large as -2000 Volts. For detailed analysis \n                of the Freja charging events, see workpackage reports WP110, WP120 and WP130 (https://space.fmi.fi/spee/docs/), and take contact \n                withe the Swedish Institute of Space Physics, Uppsala, before using any of the data presented here. The data interpretation may \n                be heavily dependent on instrumental capabilities and measurement mode types.\n            ",
