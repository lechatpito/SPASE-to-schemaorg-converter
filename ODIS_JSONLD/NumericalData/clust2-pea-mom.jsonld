  "description": " The  CAA  Moments  data  are  electron  density,  velocity  vector, \n            pressure  tensor  and  heat  flux  vector.  The  vectors  and tensors  are  provided  in  GSE  coordinates.  Velocity  and  temperature  \n            are  also  provided  as  components  perpendicular  and parallel  to  the  magnetic field. \n            The  magnetic  field  data  is  taken  from  CSDS  FGM  PP  data,  at  present.  In  a  possible  future \n            release  we would  ideally  use CAA  FGM  data,  but  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  there  will  be  major  differences  except  in \n            very weak field regions. Furthermore : \n            * T_perp and T_para are determined by projecting the pressure tensor along the magnetic field and dividing by the density and by Boltzmanns constant. T_perp is the average of the two perpendicular components.              \n            * v_para = (v.b) b and v_perp = v - (v.b) b. where v is the velocity vector and b is the magnetic field unit vector. \n           \n           These data  are  produced on the  ground  using 3-D  data  and thus are  available at  time  resolutions  which are  limited by the \n            rate  at  which  3-D  data  can  be  transmitted.  The  data  source  used  to  generate  the  mome\n            nts  is  always  the  best  available resolution 3-D data; this means mainly 3DR data but in the case 3DX or 3DXP are available these \n            are used instead for the MOMENTS  production (see  Mode_DataOrigin_HEEA/LEEA).  Choices  on  the  best  way  to  combine  data  from  the  two \n            sensors can be made in the moments production software; in the first release the moments are made using LEEA data in the \n            energy overlap region. \n            In some situations, use of both sensors together may be a better choice, for example in case\n            s where the  distribution  changes \n            during  a  spin  as  the  method  can  resolve  time  aliasing  errors.
