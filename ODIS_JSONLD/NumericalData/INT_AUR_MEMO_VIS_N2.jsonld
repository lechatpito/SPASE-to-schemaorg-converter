  "description": "This data set contains non continuous low  resolution calibrated  wave form of the AC electric and magnetic fields in several frequency bands (50 Hz up to 240 kHz) from the  MEMO  MEDOR instrument  of the Interball-Auroral probe.\n\nA calibration file has been applied to calculate the data in physical value. The data have been transformed in physical value using in first the fourier transform and second the calibration in amplitude and phase coefficient has been applied. An inverse fourier transform is performed again to calculate the waveform in physical value.",
