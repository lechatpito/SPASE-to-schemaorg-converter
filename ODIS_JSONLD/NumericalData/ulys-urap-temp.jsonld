  "description": "The electron core temperature measurements Te are given in K and are obtained by the minimum chi-square fitting of theoritical dispersion curves of Bernstein modes to the experimental dispersion curves derived from the URAP/RAR spectra,(Moncuquet et al., J. Geophys. Res., 100, 21697-21708 , 1995 and references therein). There is two cases for the fitting:\n\n    from 15:02:30 UT to 17:06:59 UT, Ne is known independently and Te is the only free fitted parameter ;\n    from 17:09:06 UT to 17:50:37 UT, Ne and Te are the both free fitted parameters. \n\nThe given acquisition time is the elapsed time (UT) of the sweeping receiver at mid-time of the whole spectrum acquisition (the acquisition duration of a whole spectrum is 128s). Te_min and Te_max stands for errors bars on the temperature measurements Te. ",
