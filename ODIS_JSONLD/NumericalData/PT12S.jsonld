  "name": "Wind Solar Wind Experiment (SWE) Strahl Detector Two Dimensional Electron Angular Distributions, (H4), 12 s Data",
  "sdDatePublished": "2021-05-31",
  "description": "Explanatory Notes: The 2D Electron Angular Distributions included in this Data Set were measured by the Wind/SWE Strahl Detector (see Ogilvie et al., \"SWE, a Comprehensive Plasma Instrument for the Wind Spacecraft\", Space Sci. Rev., 71, 55, 1995). Each Angular Distribution was measured at a single Electron Energy. The Energy was selected by applying a Voltage between the Electrostatic Analyzer Plates. The Detector sampled 32 Energies between 19 eV and 1238 eV, and during normal Operation would Sweep through these Energies one at a Time with approximately 12 s Cadence. The 12 Anodes of the Instrument are set in a vertical Pattern in a Plane that contains the Spacecraft Spin Axis, spanning a Field of View +/-28\u00b0 centered around the Ecliptic (with uneven Angular spacing between Anodes). The Wind Spacecraft Spin Axis is set at a Right Angle with the Ecliptic Plane, allowing different Azimuthal Angles to be sampled as the Spacecraft Spins (3 s Spin Period). These Azimuthal Bins have a Fixed Separation of 3.53\u00b0. Each Strahl (and Antistrahl) Distribution measured by the Spacecraft consists of a 14 \u2a2f 12 Angular Grid of Electron Counts, that was measured at a Fixed Energy during a single Spacecraft Spin. Counts are converted into Physical Units of f(v) (e.g., cm^-6s^3) in the standard Fashion by accounting for the Detector Efficiency and Geometric Factor. The Data Set reported here contains: f_strahl, f_antistrahl, f_strahl_counts, f_antistrahl_counts, phi_strahl, phi_antistrahl, theta, energy.",
