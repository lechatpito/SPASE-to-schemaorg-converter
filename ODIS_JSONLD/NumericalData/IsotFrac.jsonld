  "description": "This data product consists of a single ASCII file \ncontaining values and their uncertainties for isotopic fractions of 56 \nspecific isotopes relative to isotope-integrated elemental abundances, \nfor 15 elements (Be, B, N, S, Cl, Ar, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni).  \nBetween this data product and a companion product with isotopic abundance \nratios, isotopic composition information is given for 21 chemical elements.  \nThe fractions are based on 1978-1981 observations of ~50-500 MeV/n cosmic \nrays by the U. Chicago cosmic ray experiment on ISEE 3.  Each of the ratios \nis linked in the ASCII file to the publication where its derivation is \ndiscussed.",
