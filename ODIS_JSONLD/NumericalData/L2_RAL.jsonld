Images stored in FITS files with filenames such as \"20140101_180501_24h1A_br11.fts\". The meaning of the different parts of this filename is as follows:\n\n* 20140101 is the observation date, 2014-01-01;\n* 180501 is the observation time, 18:05:01 UT;\n* 2 represents Level-2;\n* 4 is a code for the data units, where 4=Dn/Sec/Pixel, b=Mean Solar Brightness (MSB), and t=S10. MSB \\& S10 have the diffuse source correction applied;\n* h1 or h2 for HI-1 or HI-2;\n* A or B for STEREO-A or STEREO-B;\n* br for Buffinton/RAL background subtracted--a full running window where the F-corona is computed as the mean of the lowest quartile of pixels;\n* 11 is the length of the running window in days, usually either 01 or 11 for HI-1, and 03 or 11 for HI-2.\n",
