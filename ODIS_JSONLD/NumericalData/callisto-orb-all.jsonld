  "description": "Callisto is the outermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. \n    It orbits at a distance of approximately 26 radius of Jupiter.\n    This is significantly larger than the orbital radius of the next-closest Galilean satellite, Ganymede. \n    As a result of this relatively distant orbit, Callisto does not participate in the mean-motion resonance in which the three inner Galilean satellites are locked \n    and probably never has. \n\nLike most other regular planetary moons, Callisto's rotation is locked to be synchronous with \nits orbit. The length of Callisto's day, simultaneously its orbital period, is about 16.7 Earth days. \nIts orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination \nchanging quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. \nThe ranges of change are 0.0072\u20130.0076 and 0.20\u20130.60\u00b0, respectively. \nThese orbital variations cause the axial tilt  to vary between 0.4 and 1.6\u00b0.\n\nThe dynamical isolation of Callisto means that it has never been appreciably tidally heated, \nwhich has important consequences for its internal structure and evolution. Its distance from \nJupiter also means that the charged-particle flux from Jupiter's magnetosphere at its surface \nis relatively low about 300 times lower than, for example, that at Europa. \nHence, unlike the other Galilean moons, charged-particle irradiation has had a relatively minor effect on Callisto's surface.\nThe radiation level at Callisto's surface is equivalent to a dose of about 0.01 rem (0.1 mSv) per day, which is over ten times higher than Earth's average background radiation.",
