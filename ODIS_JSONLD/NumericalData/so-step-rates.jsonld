  "description": "Solar Orbiter, Level 2 Data, Energetic Particle Detector, SupraThermal Electrons and Protons, Rates.\n              \n          STEP is designed to measure electrons and ions in the suprathermal energy range (280 keV). To \n          allow for the separation of electrons and ions, STEP has 2 different channels, each equipped with its \n          own solid state detectors for detecting particles: \n          * Magnet channel. Uses a permanent magnet to deflect electrons, measuring only ions (mostly protons). \n          * Integral channel. Measures all incoming particles.\n          \n          The electron flux is recovered by subtracting the magnet channel measurements from the integral \n          channel ones. Each channel is divided in 15 sectors, disposed in 3 rows of 5 pixels, providing \n          directional information of the incoming particles within the field of view. An additional pixel, not directly \n          exposed to the incoming flux, measures the cosmic ray background.",
