  "description": "This data set contains the PARKER SOLAR PROBE FIELDS Level 3 Merged Search Coil and Fluxgate Magnetometer (SCaM) data.\nSCaM waveforms consist of three components of the magnetic field with full frequency resolution from DC to the Nyquist frequency (in general, 146.48 Hz). For encounter 1, the SCaM product is available in RTN and in spacecraft (SC) coordinates. For encounters 2 and beyond, when the Bu antenna of the search-coil stopped working properly, it was not possible anymore to deliver a merged dataset in either RTN or spacecraft coordinates. However, a merged magnetic field dataset is still available for the Bv and Bw components only, i.e. in the coordinate system of the search-coil.\nTime (epoch) is in TT2000 format and corresponds to nanoseconds since 1 Jan 2000 12:00:00 with leap seconds included. The magnetic field is in nT.\nCalculation of the PSP-Sun distance for the selection criterion (see Filter tab) is realized each day at 00:00.\nFor further information, contact: Trevor Bowen (Univ.

Not all flags are relevant to all FIELDS data products, refer to notes in the CDF metadata and on the FIELDS Satellite Operations Center, SOC, website for information on how the various flags impact FIELDS data. For more information on the quality flags describing high frequency noise and antennas driven to the rails, see release notes for PSP/FIELDS releases 8 and 9. Additional flagged items may be added in the future."
