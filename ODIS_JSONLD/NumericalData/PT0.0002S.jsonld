  "sdDatePublished": "2022-02-19",
  "description": "This dataset consists of 2 MHz wide very-high time resolution spectrograms in Right or Left Circular Polarization tunable from 16-32 MHz. These observations were made at the AJ4CO Observatory using a Terminated Folded Dipole (TFD) Array and a Tunable Wideband Receiver system. The system provides either Right Circularly Polarized (RCP) or Left Circularly Polarized (LCP) data. These data are generated using the Radio-Sky Spectrograph Software.\n\nThese data may include observations of Solar Radio Bursts, Jupiter decametric radio emission, or Galactic Background radio emission. In particular these data enable studies of fine-structure in Jovian decametric S-bursts.\n\nThe Radio-SkyPipe produced datafiles consist of a fixed length header and a variable length note. The data portion of the file for one channel of data consists of an 8 byte timestamp using the VisualBasic 6 date format (days since 1 Jan 1900) followed by one 8 byte data value (Channel 1), this pattern repeats until the end of file. More details on the format of Radio-Sky Spectrograph datafiles can be found in the Data File Structure document on the Radio-SkyPipe help page (see Information URL).",
