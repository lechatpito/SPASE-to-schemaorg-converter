  "description": "         \n             The HET is a cylinder containing a central stack of detector disks and two single detector disks, \n             one at each end. The individual detectors in the central stack have thicknesses of 1000 microns. \n             Three of the detectors in the central stack comprise two 1000-micron disks connected to act as single \n             2000 micron detectors. The end detector disks are 500 microns thick. The front end detector and the \n             outermost detectors at each end of the central stack are each divided into five active elements, \n             a central bulls-eye and four quadrants, each of equal area. Which active area hit on different disks \n             gives directional information on the particle. An outer annular segment of each detector acts as an \n             anti-coincidence shield to detect particles that exit the cylinder before passing through all the detectors. \n             The HET covers electrons up to approximately 6 MeV and protons and heavy ions to at least 100 MeV/n. \n             The lower range overlaps the high end of the Low Energy Telescopes. \n             The measurements are divided into two different sides of the instrument, A and B\n         ",
