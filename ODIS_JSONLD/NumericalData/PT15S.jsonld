  "name": "Mauna Loa Solar Observatory K-Coronagraph Polarized Brightness, 15 s Images",
  "sdDatePublished": "2013-09-30",
  "description": "The calibrated coronal polarizion brightness, pB, fits images are expressed in units of B/Bsun, where Bsun is the brightness of the solar disk. The brightness is produced by photospheric photons that are Thomson scattered by coronal electrons, with the brightness being proportional to the density of coronal electrons along the line-of-sightof the observer. These data are good for determining electron line-of-sight densities and estimating the mass of coronal structures.\r\n\r\nTypical pB values of the solar corona in the K-Cor field-of-view (1.05 to 3 solar radii) are 10^-6 to 10^-9 B/Bsun. Images are averaged over 15 s to acquire sufficient signal-to-noise. The pB images have a nominal cadence of 15 s and are also available as 2 min averages and a daily 10 min average image.\r\n\r\nCalibration steps include: camera non-linearity correction, dark and gain corrections, polarization demodulation, distortion correction, combining images from two cameras, remove sky polarization, and correction for variations over the day in sky transmission.",
