  "sdDatePublished": "2016-07-21",
  "description": "The eastward, northward and vertical wind data in the equatorial mesosphere and lower thermosphere (52-122 km) estimated from the observation data of the MF radar at Pameungpeuk, Indonesia (7.65S, 107.69E). The data are stored in the netCDF (network Common Data From) file named (year)(month)(day)_pam.nc. The netCDF file includes time, range, and wind velocity (eastward, northward and vertical components) of the original data in the binary format (Spaced Sensor Wind Measurement Analysis: SSWMA). The upper limit of observation range was changed from 98 km to 122 km on the nightside (17:30-06:00 LT) as a regular operation after October 18, 2007. There were occasionally test operations extended up to 122 km in the period from April 19 to October 17, 2007. The wind data corresponding to \"bad\" status code (other than 0) in the original data are replaced by missing value.",
