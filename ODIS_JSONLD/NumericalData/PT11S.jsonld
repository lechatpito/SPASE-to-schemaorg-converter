  "description": "This data set contains Level 3 wave electric field and search coil wave magnetic fields data from the Electric Field and Waves Suite (EFW) onboard Van Allen Probe A. The spin-fit electric field (spin period resolution) tends to be the most accurate electric field measurement. However, as always, due diligence by the user/scientists must be exercised in using these data. The spin-fit electric field is provided in both an inertial and co-rotating frame. The electric field is presented in a MGSE (modified GSE) coordinate system. We provide two components (Y MGSE and Z MGSE) of the electric field. Both components are in the spin plane of the spacecraft and are measured with the long 50 m booms. The X MGSE component is along the spin-axis. The spin-axis of the spacecraft is oriented within 37 degrees of the Earth sun line. So the Y GSE direction is most nearly aligned with the Y MGSE axis and the Z MGSE direction is most nearly aligned with Z GSE.",
