  "name": "Cluster-Tango Waves of HF and Sounder for Probing Electron Density by Relaxation (WHISPER) Active Electric Power Spectral Density",
  "sdDatePublished": "2018-06-28",
  "description": "The Waves of HIgh frequency and Sounder for Probing of Electron density by Relaxation (WHISPER) performs the measurement of the electron density on the four satellites of the Cluster project. The two main purposes of the WHISPER experiment are to record the natural waves and to make a diagnostic of the electron density using the sounding technique. The various working modes and the fourier transforms calculated on board provide a good frequency resolution obtained in the bandwidth 2-83 kHz. Onboard data compression by the Digital Wave Processing (DWP) intrument allows a good dynamic and level resolution of the electric signal amplitude. Data products available from the Cluster Science Archive include: electric spectral power density (natural spectra and active spectra), electric spectral power density from passive emission during sounding, and electric waveform power density in 0.2 second resolution. Ancillary data include Quicklook plots (JPEG) in both active and natural mode, sounding times, housekeeping data, instrument parameters during natural and active mode, and active to passive spectral power density coded ratio. Access to data through the Cluster Science Archive is available via a java GUI interface and a command-line interface. Registration is required.",
