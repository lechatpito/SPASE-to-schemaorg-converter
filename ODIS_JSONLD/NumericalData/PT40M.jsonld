  "description": "The Heliospheric Imager-1 (HI-1) telescope is part of the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigations (SECCHI) instrument suite on the NASA STEREO mission. The SECCHI on the two STEREO spacecraft are identical suites of remote sensing instruments designed to observe coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Sun and in transit outwards to 1 AU. The HI-1 telescope observes the inner heliosphere from 12 to 84 solar radii with the band-pass wavelength of 450-750 nm.",
