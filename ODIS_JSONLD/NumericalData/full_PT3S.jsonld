  "description": "THEMIS Ground All Sky Imager at Yellowknife (62.52 deg GLat, 245.69 deg GLong): 256 x 256 pixel full resolution images of auroral oval.  The ASI stations monitor a 170 degree field of view imaging the auroral oval at kilometer resolution.  The ASI is comprised of a fisheye lens and CCD in a stainless steel enclosure topped with a transparent acrylic dome.  The CCD has a resolution of 256 x 256 pixels.  Exposure control ranges from 5 s to 1 ms although the typical data rate is one image every 3 seconds.  Silicone heaters keep the instrument within the nominal temperature range.  During daylight hours a sun shades deploy to protect the CCD.\r\n\t  ",
