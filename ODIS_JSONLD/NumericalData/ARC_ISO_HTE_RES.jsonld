  "description": "This data set contains ARCAD-3 Isoprobe  waveform data (data set information, tracking frequency of the extremum).\nThe high resolution data correspond to a frequency tracking of the resonance or an anti-resonance of the mutual impedance response. As the resonance frequency is related to the electron density and the anti-resonance frequency to the Debye length, these data (used as waveform data) allow studies of density and/or temperature fluctuations.\nThe extremum trackings, one per probe, are available in the Self-Oscillating mode, Maximum and Minimum search modes. The different combinations are : AUT-AUT, MAX-MAX, MAX-MIN and MIN-MIN. The number of samples and the time resolution depend on the type of telemetry : 256 samples with a resolution of 50 ms in TMS120, 200 samples with a resolution of 20 ms in TMS30, 1680 samples with a resolution of 2.5 ms in TMS4 and 19672 samples with a resolution of 0.2 ms in TMF.\nThe set of data contains : general information (orbit, telemetry, ...), house-keeping parameters, ancillary parameters (local time, latitude, longitude, ...) and the waveform data (data set information, tracking frequency of the extremum).",
