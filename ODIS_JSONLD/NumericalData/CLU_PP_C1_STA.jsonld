  "description": "This data set contains the Cluster 1 STAFF Prime Parameters (spin averaged) : the parallel and perpendicular (to the FGM measured magnetic field) power of the magnetic field and the power of the spin-plane components of the electric field for several frequency ranges.\n\nCaveats\n\nThe STAFF prime parameters do not have the standard CSDS timing which is synchronous with the spacecraft spin clock. The operation of the STAFF digital spectrum analyser is synchronised with the DWP clock.\n\nThe summary parameters are the average of all those instrument measurements made during STAFF 4 s periods whose middle times lie within the minute boundaries. The difference from the standard CSDS definition is negligible for all practical purposes.\n\nThe summary parameter and prime parameter E_pow_f2 is supplied by STAFF only when the satellites are in normal mode.\n\nIn burst mode both STAFF and EFW measure the waveform to 180 Hz, and the onboard spectrum analyser is not used to determine the spectrum in the band 10-180 Hz. The parameters B_pow_f2, E_pow_f2, B_par_f2, and B_perp_f2 are determined from the waveform measurements which, in the case of the electric field, come from EFW. Thus in normal mode the parameter E_pow_f2 is supplied by STAFF, while in burst mode it is replaced by the parameter of the same name from the EFW experiment.",
