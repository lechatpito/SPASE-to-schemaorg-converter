  "description": "This data set contains total ion densities obtained at 16ms resolution from the DE 2 Retarding Potential Analyzer. Corrections for spacecraft potential were included in the density determinations. Data are available in ASCII from nssdcftp and in CDF format from CDAWeb (as well as CDAWeb plots and lists). The data span the 18-month DE 2 lifetime, except for a gap from 1981/317 to 1982/057.",
