  "description": "The coordinate resolution for the magnetic field components is the\nI,S coordinate system, defined by the JPL group before launch.  I is\nthe unit vector in the direction of the ICE spin axis (positive in\nthe northward direction), and S is the unit vector from the space-\ncraft to the Sun.  The Z-axis ia equal to I, the Y-axis to the nor-\nmalized cross-product I x S, and the x-axis to Y x Z.  The I,S co-\nordinate system us approximately the same as the Solar Ecliptic (SE)\nsystem since the spacecraft Z-axis is maintained within half a degree\nof perpendicular to the Ecliptic plane.  (SE is defined the same way\nas GSE, but with the spacecraft [point of observation] substituted\nfor Earth). ",
