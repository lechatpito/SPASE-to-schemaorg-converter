  "description": "The discrete frequencies Solar Radio data, also known as Radio Interference Monitoring Sets (RIMS), is obtained from Learmonth Solar Observatory, Western Australia, Australia. A radio telescope with three parabolic dish antennae to monitor solar radio flux on 8 discrete frequencies in the range 245-15400 MHz. The three parabolic dish antennae feed eight, single frequency, radio telescopes. The largest antenna, 28 feet (8.5 meters) diameter, is used to monitor 245, 410 and 610 MHz. An 8 feet (2.4 meters) dish is used to monitor the microwave frequencies of 1415, 2695, 4995 and 8800 MHz. A small 3 feet (1 meter) dish monitors the high microwave frequency of 15400 MHz. Radio telescope outputs are digitised (1 Hz sampling rate), collected by computer and transferred to Sydney SWS head Office WDC for process and archive. Observers in Learmonth also send DVDs with RIMS (2 DVD per year) to SWS as backup for the FTP data. Up to date, we have archived four different formats of RIMS data. They are SRD (from 2005), APL (1999-2008), LSR (1991-2006) and rdata (2003-2005). All of them are available on our FTP server and SWS website. All of the data files are online plottable and downloadable.",
