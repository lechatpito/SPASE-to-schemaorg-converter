  "description": "Ionograms are an image of frequency versus time delay (virtual height) of HF echoes from the ionosphere recorded by an ionosonde. An ionosonde is a swept frequency HF pulsed radar used to monitor the ionosphere. SWS WDC has archived ionogram data from 26 stations, 12 of them are still active at present. An IPS 5D ionosonde has been sounding since 06/12/2005 at Canberra. The 5D vertical sounding ionosondes normally sweep in frequency from about 1 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 5D is 5kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale. Every five minutes, a Ionogram data file is recorded, cleaned and the cleaned ionogram is transfered to SWS Sydney head office for autoscaling and further analysis. The raw ionogram file is recorded in a DVD monthly, which will be posted to Sydney SWS head office every month. During 09/06/1994 to 22/06/1997, Canberra also had an IPS 4D ionosonde. During 01/01/1991 to 11/11/1996, an IPS 5a ionosonde. and During 02/11/1997 to 28/08/2012, a CADI ionosonde. The IPS 5D ionosonde was stopped in 25/09/2019 and replaced by an IPS 5F ionosonde since 25/09/2019. SWS WDC archives all raw ionogram files and cleaned ionogram files. The Canberra digital clean ionogram data is available since 01/01/1991, and digital raw ionogram data since 09/06/1994. The Canberra scaled hourly ionospheric data include parameters of foF2, foF1, FoE, foEs, fbEs, fmin, fxl, f'scaling F/s, M(3000)F2, h'F2, h'F, h'E, h'Es, h'Scaling R/S and Type Es. They are avalable since 01/01/1944. The Canberra median data of foF2 and M(3000)F2 are available since 01/1938.\r\n      ",
