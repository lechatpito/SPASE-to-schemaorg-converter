  "description": "This data set contains Wind Waves RADIO RAD1 60-second Averaged Data (Range 1.075 - 13.825 MHz, number of channels 16, 32, 64 or 256)\n Experimental data have been processed and averaged over 60-second intervalls from the corresponding high resolution datasets at L2 level. They are presented as temporal series. Each record consists on an averaged spectrum (given in \u00b5V^2/Hz @ PA), as well as the minimum and maximum spectrum values.\nInterpolations are performed in the case of missing/bad values, while the min. and max. values are left equal to -1.0e31.\nThe intensity modulation due to the spacecraft rotation, as well as the background level are not removed from the data.",
