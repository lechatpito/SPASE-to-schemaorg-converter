  "description": "\n                The Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) of the Comprehensive Plasma Instrumentation (CPI) on Geotail is a quadrispherical plasma analyzer  \n                that measures three-dimensional fluxes of ions in the range 150-7,000 eV/Q.  \n                Version 6 data processing replaced version 5 processing for data after March 10,\n                2006, when the CPI team started using 64 energy steps per spectrum instead of \n                the previously used 32 steps per spectrum.  The change was made to ensure that \n                even for very cold flows, the spectrum would have a sufficient number of \n                significant points to derive moments.  The change resulted in 96s spectra and \n                96s-resolution moments, vs. 48s previously. \n                CPI/SWEA and LEP measurement are expected to be used in a complementary way. LEP is highly sensitive and is dedicated to \n                measure tenuous plasma of the magnetosphere. However, when GEOTAIL is in the interplanetary, LEP generally  scans only the \n                high energy (> 5 KeV) part of the ion distribution. This automated mode allows to assure long term preservation of the LEP \n                detectors. The LEP ion moments obtained in the inteerplanetary medium should be used only for qualitative purposes. \n                The ion moments in the interplanetary medium are provided by the CPI/SWEA instrument designed for \n                measuring the denser magnetosheath and solar wind plasma.\n            ",
