  "description": "\r\n\t  The magnetometer data provides a measure of variations of the Earth's magnetic field in 2 or 3 orthogonal directions, typically in the geomagnetic north-south and east-west directions as well as vertically. Space Weather Services archives digital magnetometer data recorded from a number of field installations, some of which are collaborative installations with other organizations. Magnetometer data is used to derive a number of indices relevant to specific industry groups as well drive space weather warnings and alerts. Magnetometer data and its derived products are also used in Space Weather Services reports and products as well for space weather forecasting and geomagnetic storm monitoring. A geomagnetic storm is a temporary disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere caused by its interaction with transient features of the solar wind. Geomagnetic storms may be hazardous to critical infrastructure such as power networks and long pipelines as well as interfere with mineral exploration surveys and directional drilling. Geomagnetic storms also modulate hazardous environments for satellites and lead to ionospheric disturbances that cause degraded HF radio communications, radar scintillation, and compromise GNSS precision navigation systems. Geomagnetic data is used to derive products that are used in Space Weather Services' reports and alerts primarily in the form of geomagnetic indices. The Fluxgate Magnetometer in Hobart is owned and operated by Bom since 29/10/1998. An ICSWSE/BoM magnetometer was installed at Hobart on 21/11/2005 and still monitring now. Between 25/05/2015 and 09/09/2016, a ICSWSE magnetometer was temporarily in operation. The two ICSWSE magnetometers data is only available in SWS WDC Intranet.  \r\n      ",
