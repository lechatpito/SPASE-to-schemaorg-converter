  "description": "Titan orbits Saturn once every 15 days and 22 hours. Like the Moon and many of the satellites of the giant planets, its rotational period (its day) is identical to its orbital period; Titan is tidally locked in synchronous rotation with Saturn, and permanently shows one face to the planet, so Titan's \"day\" is equal to its orbit period. Because of this, there is a sub-Saturnian point on its surface, from which the planet would always appear to hang directly overhead. Its orbital eccentricity is 0.0288, and the orbital plane is inclined 0.348 degrees relative to the Saturnian equator. Viewed from Earth, Titan reaches an angular distance of about 20 Saturn radii (just over 1,200,000 kilometers ) from Saturn and subtends a disk 0.8 arcseconds in diameter.\n\nThe small, irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion is locked in a 3:4 orbital resonance with Titan. A \"slow and smooth\" evolution of the resonance\u2014in which Hyperion migrated from a chaotic orbit\u2014is considered unlikely, based on models. Hyperion probably formed in a stable orbital island, whereas the massive Titan absorbed or ejected bodies that made close approaches.",
