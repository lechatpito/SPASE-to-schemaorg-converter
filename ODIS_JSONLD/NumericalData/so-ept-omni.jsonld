  "description": "Solar Orbiter, Level 2 Data, Energetic Particle Detector, Electron and \n                Proton Telescope, Rates. EPT measures electrons and ions in the lower part of the \n                energetic particle spectrum. It effectuates measurements in 4 different fields of \n                view : \n                \n                * Anti-Sunward Flow. Detector looks in the direction of the mean Parker spiral towards the Sun.\n                * Sunward Flow. Detector looks opposite to the Sun direction.\n                * Northward Flow. Detector looks towards the south ecliptic hemisphere.\n                * Southward Flow. Detector looks towards the north ecliptic hemisphere.\n                                 \n                Additionally,EPT has 2 channels that separate electrons and ions: \n                * Magnet channel. Uses a permanent magnet to deflect electrons. It measures protons with energies between 25 keV and 6.5 MeV and alpha particles up to 25 MeV. \n                * Foil channel. Equipped with a foil that absorbs ions, it measures electrons in the energy range 25\u2013500 keV. Ions with energies above 400 keV can penetrate the foil, contaminating the electron measurements.",
