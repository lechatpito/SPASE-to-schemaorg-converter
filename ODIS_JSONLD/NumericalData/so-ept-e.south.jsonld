  "description": "Solar Orbiter, Level 2 Data, Energetic Particle Detector, Electron and Proton Telescope, Rates. \n              \n            EPT  measures electrons and ions in the lower part of the energetic particle spectrum. It \neffectuates measurements in 4 different fields of view :\n\n* Anti-Sunward Flow. Detector looks in the direction of the mean Parker spiral towards the Sun.\n* Sunward Flow. Detector looks opposite to the Sun direction.\n* Northward Flow. Detector looks towards the south ecliptic hemisphere.\n* Southward Flow. Detector looks towards the north ecliptic hemisphere.\n\nParameter ID uses Detector looking directon.\n\nAdditionally, EPT has 2 channels that separate electrons and ions:\n* Magnet channel. Uses a permanent magnet to deflect electrons. It measures protons with energies between 25 keV and 6.5 MeV and alpha particles up to 25 MeV.\n* Foil channel. Equipped with a foil that absorbs ions, it measures electrons in the energy range 25\u2013500 keV. Ions with energies above 400 keV can penetrate the foil, contaminating the electron measurements. \n          ",
