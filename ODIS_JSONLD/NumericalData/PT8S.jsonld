  "description": "The GOES 15 Energetic Proton, Electron and Alpha Detectors (EPEAD) are essentially the same as the Energetic Particle Sensor (EPS) on GOES 8-12. There are two EPEADs on each satellite, one looking east and one looking west. For more information, please see Onsager et al. 1996, Operational uses of the GOES energetic particle detectors, in GOES 8 and Beyond, Proc. SPIE, Vol. 2812, edited by E. R. Washwell, pp. 281-290, Bellingham, WA. These data file contain mainly information on the proton fluxes with energies from 0.74 to 4.2 MeV from both the A and B detectors. Data files contain long descriptive header.",
