  "description": "The F10.7 radio flux measured at Earth is used to estimate the solar EUV flux from 2-100 nm at Earth. These values are then scaled to Mars' orbital distance from the Sun using a 1/r2 scaling, and time-shifted to account for the solar longitude difference between the Earth and Sun. A 26-day solar rotation rate is assumed.                         \n         ",
