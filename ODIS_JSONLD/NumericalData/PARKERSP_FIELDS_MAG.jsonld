  "description": "This data set contains  the PARKER SOLAR PROBE FIELDS Level 2 Fluxgate Magnetometer (MAG) data.\nThe waveforms consist of 3 components of the magnetic field, expressed in RTN coordinates (BR, BT, BN) and in spacecraft coordinates (Bx, By, Bz). The MAG has a bandwidth of approximately 100 Hz and operates almost continuously during the full orbit. The time resolution for the waveforms is 150000 Hz / 2^N. During encounter phases (i.e. during a period of typically two weeks around each perihelion) either N=9, giving 292.969 samples per second or N=10, giving 146.484 samples per second. The measurement dynamic range of MAG is \u00b165,536 nT with a resolution of 16 bits.\nMAG data are in nT units. Time (epoch) is in TT2000 format and corresponds to nanoseconds since 1 Jan 2000 12:00:00 with leap seconds included.\nCalculation of the PSP-Sun distance for the selection criterion (see Filter tab) is realized each day at 00:00.\nReferences:\nFIELDS website: https://fields.ssl.berkeley.edu/\nBale, S. et al.

Not all flags are relevant to all FIELDS data products, refer to notes in the CDF metadata and on the FIELDS Satellite Operations Center, SOC, website for information on how the various flags impact FIELDS data. For more information on the quality flags describing high frequency noise and antennas driven to the rails, see release notes for PSP/FIELDS releases 8 and 9. Additional flagged items may be added in the future."
