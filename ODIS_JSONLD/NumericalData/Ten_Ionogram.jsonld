  "description": "Ionograms are an image of frequency versus time delay (virtual height) of HF echoes from the ionosphere recorded by an ionosonde. An ionosonde is a swept frequency HF pulsed radar used to monitor the ionosphere. SWS WDC has archived ionogram data from 26 stations, 12 of them are still active at present. A vertical analog ionosonde had been installed at Tennant Creek and sounded since 02/05/1985 to 12/11/1985. The vertical sounding ionosondes normally sweep in frequency from about 1 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution is 5kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale. Every five minutes, a Ionogram data file was recorded. The raw ionogram is recorded in a film, which will be posted to Sydney SWS head office. SWS manually scaled and archived all ionogram films. Ther is no digital raw or clean ionogram data for Tennant Creek. The Tennant Creek scaled hourly ionospheric data include parameters of foF2, foF1, FoE, foEs, fbEs, fmin, fxl, f'scaling F/s, M(3000)F2, h'F2, h'F, h'E, h'Es, h'Scaling R/S and Type Es. They are avalable since 02/05/1985 to 12/11/1985.\n\nThe Tennant Creek median data of foF2 and M(3000)F2 are available since 05/1985 to 11/1985. Tennant Creek station was closed in November 1985.",
